* graphics processing unit (GPU) is a computer chip that renders graphics and images by performing rapid mathematical calculations. GPUs are used for both professional and personal computing. Traditionally, GPUs are responsible for the rendering of 2D and 3D images, animations and video -- even though, now, they have a wider use range.

* In the early days of computing, the central processing unit (CPU) performed these calculations. As more graphics-intensive applications were developed, however, their demands put a strain on the CPU and decreased performance. GPUs were developed as a way to offload those tasks from CPUs and to improve the rendering of 3D graphics. GPUs work by using a method called parallel processing, where multiple processors handle separate parts of the same task.

* GPUs are well known in PC (personal computer) gaming, allowing for smooth, high-quality graphics rendering. Developers also began using GPUs as a way to accelerate workloads in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI).
